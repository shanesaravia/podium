BE:
    ✔ API calls are sometimes not returning all the correct results. API rate limits maybe? Add an algorithm for optimal api calls. @done(23-03-14 00:17)
FE:
    ✔ Add api call when adding a user to see if they exist. Or maybe from the BE just return a failed response that the FE can undo any changes if they add a user that doesn't exist. @done(23-03-14 00:17)
    ✔ Add FE into some kind of nice table. @done(23-03-03 01:11)
